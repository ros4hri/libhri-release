    ## This setting is relevant mostly if the standard Python package layout cannot
    ## be assumed for 'sphinx-apidoc' invocation. The user can provide the path
    ## (relative to the 'package.xml' file) where the Python modules defined by this
    ## package are located.
    python_source: 'src/pyhri'

    ## This setting, if true, attempts to run `doxygen` and the `breathe`/`exhale`
    ## extensions to `sphinx` regardless of build type. This is most useful if the
    ## user would like to generate C/C++ API documentation for a package that is not
    ## of the `ament_cmake/cmake` build type.

    ## This setting, if true, attempts to run `sphinx-apidoc` regardless of build
    ## type. This is most useful if the user would like to generate Python API
    ## documentation for a package that is not of the `ament_python` build type.

    # This setting, if provided, will override the build_type of this package

builders:
    ## Each stanza represents a separate build step, performed by a specific 'builder'.
    ## The key of each stanza is the builder to use; this must be one of the
    ## available builders.
    ## The value of each stanza is a dictionary of settings for the builder that
    ## outputs to that directory.
    ## Required keys in the settings dictionary are:
    ##  * 'output_dir' - determines output subdirectory for builder instance
    ##                   relative to --output-directory
    ##  * 'name' - used when referencing the built docs from the index.

  #- doxygen: {
  #      name: 'pyhri Public C/C++ API',
  #      output_dir: 'generated/doxygen'
  #  }
